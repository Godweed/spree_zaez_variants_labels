Variant Labels for Spree stores
=======================

Create labels for your variants and manage what labels are applied into a Variant

How to Use
----------

Access labels management trough products sub menu, then create your labels with their names (which will be displayed inside the label) and the label color.

**Do note that this gem does not handle frontend display as it current state, it only provides the relationship between labels and variants so you can handle your own rendering**

After creating your labels, go edit a variant and you must seee a checkbox list to manage which labels will be used with the variant being edited.


Installation
------------

Add spree_zaez_variants_labels to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_zaez_variants_labels'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_zaez_variants_labels:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
